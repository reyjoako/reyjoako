- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @reyjoako
- üëÄ I‚Äôm a problem solver from M√©xico, interested in Project Management, technology, biohacking, fitness and really in almost anything. I created this space to serve 
as a compilation of my projects, interests and my "backlog". I'll upload everything of my interest and try to categorize it, so you can scroll through it. 
Since I'm from M√©xico, I speak spanish, so you will find articles in both english and spanish. If you need any translation or help just let me now and I'll try to at
least explain or point in the right direction.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Project Management from Google
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects that involve helping the community
- üì´ Reach me on twitter
